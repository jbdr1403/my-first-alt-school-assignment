      <h3>Biography</h3>
      <p>
        I am a student of the School of Engineering at Alt School Africa,
        studying Cloud Engineering. I am a passionate learner and this is my
        third attempt at Alt School Africa. I am excited to be part of this
        program and I am looking forward to learning new skills and languages
        relevant to my path. I joined Alt School Africa to achieve my dream of
        becoming a cloud engineer and it has been fun so far so good. I support
        Manchester United because I love football. I am currently running a MSc
        programme in Management at a prestigious university in the UK.
